# BeirutAI - NLP Part 2

Beirut AI second NLP workshop: Word Embeddings

[Last Workshop](https://github.com/cityai/technical-workshops/tree/master/IntroNLP), we introduced NLP and we coded an AI that is able to predict Stackoverflow questions tags given the questions. We relied completely on Bag of Words (a well-known technique to convert text into numerical values machines can understand). We concluded with some limitations of Bag of Words, such as inability of understanding semanrics & meanings.

In this workshop, we introduce a new technique called Word Embeddings, which is well-known by its ability of interpreting meanings and relations. For the hands-on session, we use Word embeddings to predict the sentiment of IMDB movies reviews.
